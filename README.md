# Chaos Plugin

Chaos is an Obsidian plugin for those who strive in organized chaos.
Treat your tasks, notes, reminders, projects, whatever, as "things I need to do/look at until this date" and manage them using the power of markdown notes.

## Settings

- `Default folder`: fallback folder used when a type-specific folder is not set.
- `Project folder`, `Task folder`, `Reminder folder`, `Event folder`, `Note folder`: optional folders for each type.
- If a type-specific folder is empty, the plugin uses `Default folder`.
